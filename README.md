# International bilateral trade growth network

The International Trade Centre is an auxiliary group of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It provides trade-related technical assistance
and bilateral trading data between its member countries and economic territories. 

We have collected bilateral average trade growth rates between 2011 and 2015 among 231 countries and territories. The network has 231 vertices (country or territory) and 16,356 edges. Each signed and
weighted edge indicates the average of the total trade rate (import and export) between two members. The sign of each edge depends on the positive-negative growth rate.

The main finding of this analysis can be found in [Page 67 Section 4.4.2 in my MSc thesis dissertation](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/24/1.0347257/4)
